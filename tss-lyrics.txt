Ascending Masters 1 Lyrics

JUICE BREW

Verse 1 (Theosyn):

double cuppin Kratom that my healthy drug arrangement 
medicated vapor got my whole shit elevated
conscious substance user psychedelics that's the movement
show me what I need to get the kundalini cruisin
castin light on shadows like a beacon to the demons 
sittin deep in meditation I can see the pieces
coalesce on levels the ego can't manage
let it sink the center then rip off the bandage
get a quick exit the prison abandoned
get a bliss ticket them wishes Alladin’ed
Ugh, free from the influence
livin life genuine
How high can u really get
Ain't touched the ceiling yet
Karma on fleek like we balanced all the bullshit
Light body activated third eye full clip
Bang, Trinity winning again
this just a bit of the plan
building a bridge to the land 
New earth we buildin the brand
Sponsor we for 5d shift escalation
Hop up on the spaceshift its a celebration

Chorus (OG10K + Theosyn):

Heatin up the juice brew
Break the Powder whip it in
Heatin up the juice brew
Trinity boys cookin again
Heatin up the juice brew
Water whip it fill it in
Heatin up the juice brew
We heatin up that juice brew


Verse 2 (OG10K):

How I got to this level
Crystals in my bezel
Heavy in the backseat
Stones you need a shovel
Boy you need a dremel
Feelin dazed up in the maze
I got it straight up from the cave
Coppin Mines up out that selenite
Cleansin auras feelin tight
right up in the night
I ride up in the night
Serving parcels of that light
Pardon for my flight
Pardon for my loose screw
Kava sippin lava fillin
Heatin' up the juice brew

Painting pictures in my mind
Visions see beyond the time
Medicine is what I need
heal my soul feel divine
Tabs up of that acid
Psilocybin feel elastic
Feel it gotta have it
U see the code jus crack it
Don't make this shit a habit
Channel feelin everlasting
Pop it with intention
For the Higher soul dimensions
Living lavish in the ether planes
I'm a maverick
Dirty dancing with my diamonds prancing
Stuntin was a habit

Chorus

Verse 3 (Theosyn):

Celebrate your core flaws
Elevate they torn off
Death to the victim mentality
You a born God 
Ward off them negative entities spirited away
High vibration the spaceship we gonna be ok
Updated DNA clutchin gems seein thangs
Altered states fall awake caution make you be a fake
We livin life like its nuttin to lose, boy
If the stakes so high then why you keep hittin snooze, boy

Verse 4 (OG10K):

Neva in trouble man
I grazed a couple hunnid lands
8 lives in my plan
Meridians showing In my hand
Pyramid up pyramid down
So high can't see the ground
Peaking to the found
Im peaking to the crown

Merkabah's in rotation
Buildin soul foundations
Creepin through the pavement
Im Seeking to amazement
Tastin all the favorites
Senses mergin I savor it
Vivid pictures frame it
The Living juice I crave it

Chorus


BUBBLIN’

Chorus (Theosyn):

Chorus

Verse 2 (OG10K):

Got the lamp lit
Ain't running through trampling
But handling the spirit of the forest
Knowledge of the oldest
Drink upon this porridge
Turning face to the sun
Now its summer solstice
Let me... hold this space
So you can come and face
The transcendent, benevolent, rise into space
Sisters and brethrens. Just let em' in
So you can choose to use it beyond your fate
Rise above this plane
Passin' through the rain
Cleansing out pain
To the limitless state of pure vigilance
No hindering what u can get to
What you can get through, with these elastic views
Cause I got that ... Rubbaband grip
Giving grace to the lands fam
Shine on my right
Whippin light with my left hand ... Whippin light with my left hand

Chorus

Spoken Outro (Theosyn):

there's a new grid emerging
a new consciousness
the old matrix is dying out
the warring, the violence, the selfishness
the intolerance 
washed away in blissful waves 
of high frequency light codes
dna activating
our true essence captivating
karma lifts
our cosmic ties emerge and illuminate the shadows of false limitations
the illusion so masterfully constructed to distract from that which we all are (originate)
source
one 
love 
everything and nothing
we merge with the all, The IAM of all being 
no more veils, no more smoke screens
present








MOUNT MERU 

Verse 1 (OG 10K)

Hop up in my spaceship
Looking glorious ain't it?
Now we past the path illusion glass
Remove the oculus from the optometrist
Now we see how far we get
How far we set our minds to
Without the glare of the blinds fool
The light, it shines through
It binds too, divine connection
With each other in this intermission
Of our sacred soul journey
With no pastor sittin'
Judgin', complimenting
We on our own, together at the same time
We in the vine, of mother goddess Durga
Hail kali, smoke this cali, smokin' shiva
Finally in line with this refer
We almost there, the peak of mount meru
Long as we get there, dont matter what we been through

Chorus (Theosyn):

Bridge (OG 10K):

Incarnated again, gettin' settled in
Got the betta' benz, yeah we goin' in again!

Verse 2 (Theosyn):

walking conscious prism 
man we stalking down that wisdom

mouth up in a glory hole
respect the energy n it respect you back
let in the heavenly get Ya weapons in tact
step on some toes n say goodbye to the lack
Everything come in cycles we circling back

Chorus

Chorus (Theosyn):

Hopped up on a higher path
Soul gift lost we buy it back
All them demons dyin bad
Fuck the odds defy the math
Higher realm the passion from
Without effort answers come
Tuned in un-plugged
Move wit that one love


Verse 1 (OG 10K):

If you losin' hopin
You can focus on the lotus
Don't forget the realms
You the one, You the chosen

If you fell off the path you can get it back
Transmit the love like a whiplash
Eyelash of your third eye tweakin'
Raise your self upon this beacon

See what you built
See what you raised
One with the source
On the same page

Diamond light frequencies
Penetratin' mother earth
Synchronizing linking trees
Cards were always up my sleeve

Pet the peeves, let the leaves
Heal the mind, heal the soul
Take the water, pour it in
Take a sip and let it go
Take a sip and let it go
Take a sip and let it grow

Chorus

Verse 2 (Theosyn):

timeline shiftin right up in the line of vision 
life is like a vine we inchin creepin on the come up so divine it's simple 
multidimensional beings on a human voyage 
the soul glow push the seedling thru the soil
channelin’ the message thru this vessel cosmic morse code
handlin the essence of the weapon cosmic horn blow
war cry, higher path, form die, wider grasp
phoenix wingspan wind gust feel the line unclasped
No Wellbutrin I'm well suited
To snap you outta the malaise so gruesome
The ways U used to fallin apart
old grid gone wwe openin hearts
openin Minds in the Wokest of times
Since ancients tapped into the Divine
time is illusion the matrix is real
a real illusion replacin the fear

Chorus

Verse 2 (OG 10K)

Upgradin' these charms on my chain
Do it for the light, never in vain
Flying up to the highest plane
Source, we one in the same

Snap it back and bring it up
Splashin' out that angel dust
Living like I got a screw missin
Ain't givin it up

But I'm asking what is hittin
What is on our path in this dharmic mission
The darkest hours now we risin out
Flowering out like the sky is out

Stars and the moon what's in my boon
Harnessing energy, tunin in so intentionally
That sacred chi. The universe is what's I'm meant see
Limitless is what I'm meant be

Kingship its in my creed
Follow my heart, takin the lead
In the cut, in the mud
This vessel aint a dud it's a sput

No nicks and dimes
Only eighths and whole ounces
Feeling immaculate
Dimensional analysis,

Ain't foolin around with it
'Bout to stop time with this
Flyin' the vimana ship
Young gods time travelin'


LIGHT BODY THERAPY

Bridge (Theosyn):

My body's not my body
It's my body but I'm flying
Feelin fire up the spinal
there ain't no denyin
This vessel carry me
Wear it till they bury me
Light body therapy 
Light body therapy

Verse 1 (OG 10K):

I saw the shaman standing in the mirror, crystal clear
Didn't know divinity was in sight, or even near
Even keel, I keep my phenakite extra tight upon my holster
Other couple a crystals, remind me whats the hold up
Let's activate this grid, in the midst of everchanging light
Reduce the fight, surrender to the flight
High like a kite, floatin' like a boat
Feelin' like Lil Yachty with my gold teeth and extra woes

Chorus (OG 10K) [2x]:

Out to the ether that my body get upgraded
From this flesh and bone and sticks and stones
To life in the light, geometric flights, floatin' energy
Feeling like I'm coming home ... Feeling like im coming home

Verse 2 (Theosyn):

Triple beams off the light body glistening
This a dream n we animated figurines
Spin a wreath fo the crown how Im traveling
Win a lease out on life like its happening
Moldavite by my side how I chose my flight 
Sorta tight the way we learned how ta hold the light
Go inside alchemize see change overnight 
Sometimes it take time but patience open rites

Chorus

T.R.S (Truth Reigns Supreme)

Chorus [x2]
Real talk this the land of lost
Land of the cross, Land of the bosses
Truth Reigns Supreme
Bringin' knowledge of the light
From A to the Z

Verse 1 (OG 10K):

Conscious flows through the rivers of my spine
Rivers of my mind, slivers of these slimes
Ain't slippin with this grind, I flip it with my mind
Mirrored glasses shatter from the basis of the times

I mind that, my strap ain't the dessert of my eagle
It's the clap that go bang for the desert of my people
Pleasure for my people, treasures from the steeple
Evervessant shinin' bright, bringing out that light

Verse 2 (Theosyn):

call me the sooth sayer
show you the proof layers
channel the ladder n
shatter the chute chatter

legion of light this the season of flight
fear a device son we leave it on ice 
reason to fight not a need to be right 
a need to be light leave the pleasin behind

livin fo self still respect the collective 
pivot yo wealth redirected incentive

openin doors n then soak in decor
Heiroglyphics in motion explored
time space broke the frequency shift
just gettin started forgot but it's seepin in
wisdom of ancients replenish our patience
knowledge recaptured the answers so basic
magic is ageless no panic just painless
elevation hey it's all in your making

Verse 3 (OG 10K):

Living like, living light, realign, redesign
She read my mind channeling ancient times
Sacred finds, they multiply
Dematerialize into the formless
Message from horus to add to my chorus
Starseed ... florist
Goin' in feelin glorious
On this transit that I transmit
Dont vanish. New course, dont crash it
Ever gassin' loud, feelin' proud in this cloud

Verse 4 (Theosyn):

power in numbers the consciousness raise
fuck what they say no this is not a phase
trust in yo self the power within
they try to influence the cowardly thing
Hop on the movement we got you pursuin
A life path and purpose the honesty brewin 
TRuth Rain Supreme TRS TRS
Harness your energy know you can be your best
Higher self speaking now
Synchronize even out 
Let go of fear flow be so easy now
Hold it in breath it out 
Hold it in breath it out
Kundalini that what we be about
Watched my ego crumble like a passive observer
Nuttin was the same watch we stack em up further







HIGHER SELF

Intro Bridge (Theosyn):


I saw the stars like a moon man
I am the stars like a moon man
I'm in the stars like a moon man
I see the stars like a true man


Chorus

Got it from a higher self [x2]
Ascended masters in our plane, inherited a prior wealth
Got it from a higher self [x2]
Faith in intuition, true religion, just a Higher Self

Verse 1 (Theosyn):

important cause I said it plus I am homie
bring yo track this way U want some bang on it
let go a yo past n git yo math flowin
I can show you how to do it if you Wanna be that open
throttled consciousness now you seein what the problem is
Blemish on yo soul gotta go inside n polish it
Fuck yo rules fuck yo laws fuck yo politicians raw
This is all illusion life a game but they done rigged it all
Bringin back that energy they tried to squash n wash it out
Swinging on our enemies connecting grids we bosses now
Indigo n star seeds deflect lies we never lost 
the crown
It's all inside yo heart homie, all inside your heart


Verse 2 (OG 10K):

This body is a permutation I chose, let the gates close into the light
Into the sight, sittin' with my spirit guides. What's next to build?
I feel like Drunvalo when I'm linin' up in the grid
Crystalline dreams with the ancients seams
Violet ray up in my triple beam
Light up the Palo Santo, source comin' straight from the candle
They say you have no plan though ...
Man I know. These feelings that are comin' in
It's my medicine ... It's my medicine


Hi-Tech

Verse (Theosyn):

orange goblin fuckshit
never gon take away sovereignty
all the mayo fucksticks 
karma gon claim all yo basic ways
fuck did u think we jus roll over silent
packed to the brim the resistance is wilin
facts over fuckshit the consciousness risin 
alternate frequency uzi fo eyelids
the power within these cowards pretend
we all risin up there's too many for them
when we all shed the fear in our hearts and laugh at death revolution begin
our souls live forever.. souls melt together
infinite energy shake out these devils
im sending love to my enemies (love .. to .. my .. enemies)
spread love it gon save us, what the fuck is the penalty
release the emotion old matrix control sys
free up yo power to fight wit a focus
T up the potion distribute wit open
mind to the victims of hopeless-ness
Trinity in it we winnin got hi tech
...no fussin or fidgets we ride next
...get this shit heated like pyrex
we up cookin the anecdote why rest
our weapons advanced been honin n vibin
now we approach divine timing to try them
guardians of the galaxy, level up like we pedal dust
models of the new savagery, kill em wit kindness fuck u up wit love




CLOUDS

Verse (Theosyn)

so much love in my heart might float out the booth 
go for the mark ...  u know we da truf 
lettin off steam don't u choke on the fumes
astral project we can show u the view
rose out the tombs phoenix fly out the ashes
amulet gleamin all demons get banished
holy grail moldavite spillin out chalice
dial your tuner the key to the palace
i'm an infinite being of light
ur an infinite being of light
if we can accept that
then i'm sure we'll be alright 
we all made of molecules star dust n chromosomes
activate your dna light body we goin home
this flesh is a vessel duality challenge
human school choose happy or sad shit
play the victim keep blaming symptoms 
or heal up from the inner out
i kept it dark it's so comfortable
compartmentalized pain dark lodge lunchable
now everything new 
go ahead find ya truth
got the puddin fa da proof 
get ready fa da cruise
